We used different type of algorithms to train our model like, Logistic Regression, Random Forest model, Decision tree and XGB Classifier. And Also we tuned the parameters of XGB Classifier and Random Forest model Comparing the model on the basis of precision,recall, accuracy ,F1 score we can see that the XGBClassifier model performs better.Even comparing ROC curve XGB Classifier performed better because curves closer to the top-left corner indicate better performance.
